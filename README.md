## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸ’« About Me:
Just for a bit of context, I have a Bachelor of Medical Science (First-class Hons.) where my dissertation focused on neuroinflammation in Parkinson's Disease, modelled by a 'MPTP mice model'. The intention behind it was to analyse if there were any influence of using a novel cannabinoid receptor agonist on the degeneration of dopamine neurons. After this, I worked for the Medical Oncology Clinical Trials Unit at Westmead hospital. I found myself questioning whether if this is the right decision to make for my career. Was this something I am willing to do for the remainder of my life? I could not and liked the idea of financial liberty and choosing how I should use my time to work on things that provide me fulfilment, via emotional investment into what I am working. Caring about something and how it turns out matters. That is why I decided to go back to university to pick up some meaningful skills, in tandem with self studying, to break into the tech field as soon as possible (hopefully before graduation).

<br>
I am currently a second year computer science student. Right now I am in undertaking a cybersecurity course from Google, and studying HTML-CSS to understand how to build websites. I want to branch out into these two fields because I find that Cybersecruity operations is an interesting field. It has a large set of governance that requires all cybersecurity analysts to understand to collaborate and defend against threats and protect user data and prevent breaches in to organisations. In addition, I want to learn website development, as I have heard it is an easy skill to learn, in comparison to the wide range of programming languages that are out there. I like tinkering and creating new things, hence why I started doing it and eventually would like this to lead up to a job.

I am currently looking for prospects in become an intern as a SOC analyst or in web development. I would like to also host my own portfolio website and gather experience through freelancing or making side projects.
